# Post-export patch for the Godot-generated service worker.
#
# Godot's web_pwa template serves navigation requests cache-first, so an
# installed PWA can keep launching an old build indefinitely. This patch
# flips navigation requests to network-first (cache is the offline
# fallback), so every launch picks up the newest deploy.
#
# The full atomic-update story lives in the loading shell's own version ping:
# after the game starts, the page checks for a newer build and reloads once if
# it finds one - number, engine and game data landing together, without the
# service worker forcing navigation from under a running session.
