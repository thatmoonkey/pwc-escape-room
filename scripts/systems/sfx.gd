## Every sound in the game, in one place.
##
## The players are SCENE NODES in main.tscn (the looping beds "sfx_ambience" and
## "sfx_music", the one-shots "sfx_voice") rather than being created on demand at
## runtime. That is the whole point of this revision:
##
## Adding a child to the scene root from another node's _ready() fails with
## "Parent node is busy setting up children, add_child() failed", and a play()
## on a player that never entered the tree then fails with "Playback can only
## happen when a node is inside the scene tree". That is exactly how the ambience
## came out silent. Scene nodes exist in the tree before any script's _ready()
## runs, so there is no timing window at all.
##
## If the scene nodes are ever missing, this falls back to creating a player
## under the scene root, deferred, and starts it when it actually enters the
## tree - so a one-shot is never silently dropped.

## THE MIX. A level is written as a fraction of full scale because that is how a
## mix gets discussed, and the decibel value is derived from it rather than typed
## beside it, so the two cannot drift apart.
##
## Do not read a percentage as decibels. The conversion is logarithmic, so half
## scale is -6 dB and a third is about -10.5 dB rather than -50 and -70. Two of
## these sit much lower in decibels than their percentage suggests, which is why
## the arithmetic is done here rather than guessed at by hand.

## THE MIXER. Three channels - music, ambience and sfx - each with its own mute
## and its own fader, because "turn the music down" and "turn the game down" are
## different requests and one global volume cannot answer both.
##
## The fader is a user multiplier (0..1) applied on top of each sound's design
## level, so a fader at 1.0 plays the mix as authored and a fader at 0.3 pulls
## that channel to thirty percent of it. Mute is a volume change, not a stop:
## a bed keeps playing at the mute floor so unmuting brings the track back
## exactly where it was rather than restarting it.

## THE MIXER'S MEMORY. Faders and mutes are written to user://settings.cfg the

## save is a record of WHAT was decided.

## thing anyone wants quiet during a work session, and it costs nothing to
## start that way. Ambience and sfx start audible - the room tone is the
## furniture, and a silent room reads as broken rather than as quiet.
