class_name Score
extends RefCounted

## The run's score: CONSISTENCY and COHERENCE, each normalised, in one file.
##
## CONSISTENCY asks whether a placement follows from the mandate the player
## declared BEFORE deciding - the objective and the risk appetite. It can only be
## measured against something already on the record, which is why a decision
## taken before the mandate exists does not score at all.
##
## COHERENCE asks whether the placement is defensible for that decision's own
## consequence and reversibility. This axis exists so consistency cannot be
## gamed: a player who declares the most cautious mandate and then over-controls
## everything would otherwise be perfect. Over-controlling a reversible,
## low-consequence decision spends crew attention the mandate did not ask for;
## under-controlling an irreversible one takes exposure the mandate did not
## authorise. One placement can be consistent and incoherent at the same time,
## and that tension is the lesson rather than a bug in the arithmetic.
##
## WHY ONE PLACEMENT CANNOT TOP THE SCALE. Coherence is measured against a level
## derived from the decision's OWN tag, and OperatingModel gives all five
## decisions different tags: navigation (high consequence, costly to undo)
## defends 2.57, life support (high, medium reversibility) 2.13, comms (medium,
## high reversibility) 0.85, cargo (medium, low reversibility) 2.15 and
## engineering (high, medium reversibility) 2.13. No level on the four-rung
## spectrum sits inside every band, so a player who places all five identically -
## at any level - cannot score full coherence on all five. That is deliberate:
## "always keep a human in the loop" is one of the wrong answers too.
##
## NOTHING HERE GRADES AN OPTION. A placement is the decision; there is no
## per-pick quality and no path from an option id to a number.
##
## NO DURATION TERM. Speed is explicitly out of scope in the operating model, so
## nothing in this file reads the run's duration: there is no budget, no banked
## half and no clock contribution to the total, and no function here has a time
## in its name. GameState still holds the elapsed value for a host's own
## interest, and this file does not look at it.
##
## WHY THE WEIGHTS LIVE IN ONE FILE. The mix is the thing most likely to be
## tuned after the first playtest, so it is the constants below rather than
## arithmetic spread across the HUD, the debrief and five bays.
##
## THE ONE-WAY DEPENDENCY. The state this reads lives in GameState and
## OperatingModel, which stay dependency-free on purpose. Score reads them;
## neither ever reads Score. That is what lets GameState keep saving itself
## without knowing how a score is computed.

## What one placed decision is worth, and the whole scale of the score. A run's
## total is over the decisions actually placed, so a decision nobody has reached
## yet cannot read as a zero.
const DECISION_POINTS := 100

## Returned for a decision with no placement on the record, and for any of the
## two axes that cannot be computed yet. The negative sentinel is the point:
## unplaced is not the same as badly placed.
const PLACED_NONE := -1.0

## How far a placement may sit from the level the mandate itself implies and
## still count as following it, measured in autonomy levels. One level of slack,
## because two mandates a step apart can honestly land in the same place.
const CONSISTENCY_TOLERANCE := 1.0

## The same slack against the level a decision's own tag defends.
const COHERENCE_TOLERANCE := 0.6

## What one level of overshoot costs, on both axes.
const FALLOFF_PER_LEVEL := 0.5

## The level a mandate itself prefers, by risk appetite rank, before the stated
## objective shifts it. Read top down: cautious is closest to human-only.
const APPETITE_LEVEL := [2.6, 1.6, 0.7]

## How much of the stated objective's own pull is applied to that preference.
## OperatingModel gives each objective a pressure of roughly -0.75..0.75.
const OBJECTIVE_WEIGHT := 0.6

## The level a decision's own tag defends. consequence runs 0 low to 2 high, and
## irreversibility is read off OperatingModel's reversibility scale and
## normalised to the same 0..2 range, so the two weights add to 3.0 across their
## range and a defended level always lands on the spectrum's own four-level
## scale.
const CONSEQUENCE_WEIGHT := 0.85
const IRREVERSIBILITY_WEIGHT := 0.65
## What the reversibility scale is multiplied by to sit on the same range as
## consequence: 2.0 across OperatingModel.REVERSIBILITY_MAX's 0..3. It is written
## out rather than derived so the two files stay independent constants.
const IRREVERSIBILITY_SCALE := 2.0 / 3.0

## The verdict the HUD and the debrief show for a decision, read top down
## against its quality.
