extends RefCounted

## The record of the run: the mandate the player declared, the autonomy
## placement made for each decision, the override log and the auto-save. Static
## and dependency-free (it reads OperatingModel, which reads nothing) so
## puzzles, the HUD, the debrief and any future bay can read it without autoload
## wiring.
##
## THE MANDATE AND THE PLACEMENTS ARE THE SAME RECORD. Both are written by one
## save, in one file, so a resumed session keeps the yardstick it was run
## against as well as the decisions taken against it. A decision with no
## placement is NOT a zero: it is absent, and Score reads the absence through a
## negative sentinel rather than scoring it.

## added as OPTIONAL keys, so a save written before them still loads instead of
## being discarded - bumping this would silently wipe a crew's progress.
