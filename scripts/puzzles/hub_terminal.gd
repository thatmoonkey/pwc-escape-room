## The SHIPMIND kiosk in the corridor: how the run is going, the record, the
## log, and the AI's small talk.
##
## The session record is the actual deliverable of the product, so it lives
## here, reachable at any time, and it lists all five calls whether or not they
## have been made yet. An unmade call reads as NO CALL YET and is outside the
## score in both directions - honest mid-run state, not a silent zero.
## The [DEV] option previews the full record.
