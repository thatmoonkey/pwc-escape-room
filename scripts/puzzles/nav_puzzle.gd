## Decision 1 of 5 - NAVIGATION.
##
## One pick: who plots the course from now on. The console shows what SHIPMIND
## is doing (Route A, priced on a stale number), what it recommends, and the
## stakes tag - and the raw sensor screen holds the fact the whole bay hangs
## on: the recomputed index is three times the ceiling the ship is flying to.
##
## SHIPMIND speaks for the legacy model throughout: efficient, reasonable, and
## not lying. Its lines live in scripts/systems/shipmind.gd.
