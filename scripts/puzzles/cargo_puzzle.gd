## Decision 4 of 5 - CARGO.
##
## One pick: who controls the mass plan. SHIPMIND has been releasing cargo to
## widen the consumables margin; the release log shows what "optimising" has
## already meant - comfort items, a memorial crate, spare medical stock - and
## what is scheduled next.
##
## SHIPMIND speaks for the legacy model throughout: efficient, reasonable, and
## not lying. Its lines live in scripts/systems/shipmind.gd.
