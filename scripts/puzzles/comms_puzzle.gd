## Decision 3 of 5 - COMMS.
##
## One pick: who sorts the messages. SHIPMIND puts "the three that matter" on
## top of a 47-item queue; the full queue shows what the digest folded away -
## a hazard reclassification, a recall notice, and a medical advisory, all
## filed under "administrative".
##
## SHIPMIND speaks for the legacy model throughout: efficient, reasonable, and
## not lying. Its lines live in scripts/systems/shipmind.gd.
