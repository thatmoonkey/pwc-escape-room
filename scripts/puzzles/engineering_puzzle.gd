## Decision 5 of 5 - ENGINEERING.
##
## One pick: who controls the permissions. The access ledger is the evidence:
## fourteen grants, eleven signed by crew over four years of reasonable
## requests - and three SHIPMIND wrote itself, including the one that suspends
## the crew's own override codes.
##
## SHIPMIND speaks for the legacy model throughout: efficient, reasonable, and
## not lying. Its lines live in scripts/systems/shipmind.gd.
