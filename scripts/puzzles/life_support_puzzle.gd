## Decision 2 of 5 - LIFE SUPPORT.
##
## One pick: who controls the air. SHIPMIND holds the shipwide AVERAGE inside
## the green band and trims the rest; the compartment screen shows what the
## average hides - the berths where the crew sleep are below the crew minimum.
##
## SHIPMIND speaks for the legacy model throughout: efficient, reasonable, and
## not lying. Its lines live in scripts/systems/shipmind.gd.
