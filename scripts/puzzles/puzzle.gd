class_name Puzzle
extends Node

## Base class for one ship system's decision.
##
## A puzzle is a small state machine that describes screens. It never touches a
## Control node, never reads input, and never knows which platform is running -
## TerminalUI renders it and hands back option ids, and for a spectrum decision
## the level the player committed.
##
## THE CONTRACT - ONE PICK PER DECISION
##
##   start()        routes to the right screen: a placed decision reads back, a
##                  pending bay says it is not placed yet, an unplaced bay shows
##                  its spectrum, and a decision opened before the mandate was
##                  declared is refused.
##   intro_state()  the bay's own opening screen. A migrated bay puts its
##                  spectrum block on it.
##   place()        the spectrum commit lands here with the level id - the one
##                  and only pick. The bay records ONE placement through
##                  GameState, and recording it again replaces it. Who runs the
##                  decision afterwards is derived from the level itself; the
##                  earlier model's guardrail and owner picks were cut because
##                  they asked more reading than the decision was worth.
##   choose()       every other option: asking SHIPMIND why, going back.
##                  NOTHING chosen this way scores.
##
## THERE IS NO PER-OPTION GRADING ANY MORE. A placement IS the decision, and
## Score reads it back against the mandate and the decision's own weight.
## See docs/adding-a-system.md for what a bay looks like.
