## Mobile input layer: two joysticks and no buttons.
##
## The sticks TELEPORT: tap the lower half of the screen and the nearest
## stick centres under your thumb, so you never have to hunt for it.
## There is no jump button: every touch outside a stick is either a look
## drag or an interact tap, so nothing can swallow a stick's release.
##
## LEFT thumb: the move stick - a ring with a smaller knob you drag inside
## it. The ring's edge is the limit of travel.
##
## RIGHT thumb: the look stick - the same kind of ring. This is what replaces
## the old raw drag-look: the knob's deflection is a RATE, not a delta, so the
## view turns smoothly and never whips - and when you let go the knob springs
## home and the view stops.
##
## A TAP on the world (not on a stick, not on a button) is interact: the
## tap casts to whatever the crew is looking at, so the whole screen is the
## interact surface and no button is needed.
##
## It feeds the same InputMap actions and the same InputRouter look delta as
## the mouse, so no room or puzzle script changes for mobile.
