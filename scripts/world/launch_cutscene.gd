## The departure, played from the helm.
##
## Three shots, and the sequence is built around one handoff. It opens at the
## helmsman's eye looking forward through the bridge glass - the planet, the
## station and the starfield the crew's bay windows have shown all game - then
## leaves the ship to watch it from outside as it gets under way.
##
## The last shot is an S around the stern: a sweep across the back of the ship,
## ignition at the end of it, and the reverse sweep out to the ship's left side
## while the three engines burn.
##
## The ship it shows is the corridor the crew actually walked: the kit walls and
## the bridge are real geometry built from these same numbers, so the vessel
## flying away is the vessel they have been inside, not a stand-in.
##
## The renderer is the WorldEnvironment every window already looks through, so
## this adds one camera, its own soft key, the three engine bells and their
## plumes - and touches nothing else: no new sky, no change to the station's
## lighting, no second starfield. The viewport is only taken over while the
## sequence runs, and the crew's own camera is restored on every exit path.

## Where the departure burn is lit. This is the HULL's stern, not the corridor's
## aft end: the ship the crew are inside runs 114 m along Z and its aft-most
## geometry is at Z -50.0, so an engine glow at the corridor's aft wall sits about
## 30 m inside the ship and throws its light on nothing the camera can see. Three
## metres behind that stern face and low, so the burn lands on the hull's own
## transom where its nozzles would be.
const ENGINE_GLOW := Vector3(0.0, 1.2, -52.0)

## THE THREE ENGINES.
##
## The hull's aft face is at Z -50.0 and the model carries its engine cluster
## there: two big nacelles low on the transom and a smaller third nozzle
## between and above them. These are measured off that cluster, not invented -
## a plume that starts beside a nozzle reads as a bug, however good the flame.
## Each nozzle carries a visible flame when the order to burn arrives. The
## plumes are geometry, not particles: a cone is deterministic, costs three
## draw calls and reads the same on web and in a headset, which matters for the
## one shot a crew sees exactly once.
const NOZZLE_POS: Array[Vector3] = [
	Vector3(-8.9, 1.9, -49.6),
	Vector3(0.0, 6.7, -49.6),

## Long enough to read as thrust, short enough that the camera can hold the

var plume_length: float = 18.0

## THE PULL-OUT - the middle shot, and where the crew's exit from the ship is
## faked.
##
## This shot used to begin 11 m INSIDE the ship and travel out through the
## stern, and that is where the visible clipping came from. The hull imports as
## one closed mesh, so from inside it every hull face is a backface and is
## culled: the plating simply disappears and the camera is left looking at the
## module's own interior fittings hanging in space. None of that is meant to be
## seen from outside the ship.
##
## So the shot BEGINS outside the shell and never re-enters it. The hull's
## aft-most geometry is at Z -50.0, and both endpoints below are aft of that, so
## every frame of the pull-out is outside the ship by construction rather than by
## eye. These points moved when the ship model was replaced: the previous hull's
## stern was at Z -38.1, and leaving them where they were would have started the
## shot six metres inside the new one.
##
## What sells the exit is the cut in from the helm: the last inside frame is the
## crew's own view forward, and the first outside frame is the same heading with
## the ship now behind them and the burn lighting its stern.
##
## It ends exactly where the reveal arc begins, so the two shots are one
## continuous move and that join cannot drift apart.
const PULLOUT_EYE := Vector3(17.0, 7.5, -58.0)
const PULLOUT_END := Vector3(6.0, 6.4, -68.0)

## THE REVEAL - the last shot, and one move rather than an S.
##
## The engines light while the camera is still astern, looking straight down the
## wake at the three bells. From there the camera circles LEFT, one way only,
## round the ship's quarter to her port side, and settles on the whole 114 m hull
## in profile with the three jets trailing behind it.
##
## Nothing sweeps right at any point: the azimuth only ever runs one way, so the
## move reads as a single orbit rather than a pan out and back.
##
## The motion stays polar about the hull's long axis, so the ship turns into
## frame instead of shrinking. Height and aim are keyed separately, and look_at
## always gets Vector3.UP, so the horizon stays level and no roll is introduced.
##
## The first frame is the last frame of the pull-out, read off PULLOUT_END
## below, so the join between the two shots cannot jump.
##
## The ship, from the hull placement receipt: 114.0 m long, along Z from -50.0
## (stern) to 64.0 (bow), 38.4 m tall from Y -12.0, centred in Z at 7.0.
const ARC_CENTRE_Z := 7.0
## Azimuth, where 0 is abeam on the ship's left (+X) and -90 is dead astern.
## The sweep ends a few degrees aft of dead abeam: a three-quarter profile still
## reads as the whole hull in profile, and it keeps the stern clear of the frame
## edge so the wake stays in shot.
