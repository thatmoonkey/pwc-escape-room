class_name BayPlate
extends Node3D

## The number plate beside each bay doorway: the bay's number with its name
## under it, on the corridor face of the spine wall next to the opening.
##
## WHY IT EXISTS. The corridors read as a run of identical doorways, and the
## kiosk and the PA speak in bay numbers and system names, so each doorway has
## to say which bay it is at a glance - including the one doorway that carries
## no door at all (navigation was left open on purpose).
##
## The plate is a child of the doorway body, which stands in the wall plane
## with the floor at local y 0, so one authored position serves both decks;
## which way the text faces is derived from the doorway's own X, the same rule
## window_wall.gd uses to tell inboard from outboard.
##
## The labels are rebuilt here on every load rather than kept as scene nodes:
## the authoring tools run _ready while packing, so a plate that saved its own
## labels would load with two copies, and the sizes and colours below are the
## single source of truth for the plate's look.

const GOLD := Color(0.941, 0.722, 0.224)   ## attention/resolved - the HUD's placed colour
const SAND := Color(0.93, 0.86, 0.76)      ## the info/neutral step of the palette
const INK := Color(0.06, 0.03, 0.02, 1.0)  ## the warm near-black the grounds use

const PIXEL_SIZE := 0.004   ## metres per font pixel, so the number renders ~0.3 m tall
const NUMBER_SIZE := 110    ## the bay number, in font pixels
const NAME_SIZE := 34       ## the bay's name, under the number
const NUMBER_LIFT := 0.20   ## the number's centre above the plate origin
const NAME_DROP := 0.14     ## the name's centre below it

## Short names for the plates. The kiosk and the door prompts speak in
## GameState.display_name, whose suffixed forms ("CARGO / RESOURCES") are
## longer than the stretch of wall beside a door, so a plate carries the short
## form; anything not listed falls back to the full display name.
